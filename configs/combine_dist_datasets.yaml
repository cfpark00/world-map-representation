# Configuration for combining distance datasets
# This combines a no-Atlantis dataset with an Atlantis-required dataset

output_dir: outputs/datasets/dist_120k_mixed

# Combination mode: 'concat' (full concatenation) or 'sample' (sample from each)
mode: concat

# Random seed for reproducibility
seed: 42

# Whether to shuffle the final combined dataset
shuffle: true

# List of datasets to combine
datasets:
  # First dataset: 20k samples without Atlantis
  - path: outputs/datasets/dist_20k_no_atlantis
    # In concat mode, n_samples and ratio are ignored
    
  # Second dataset: 100k samples with Atlantis required
  - path: outputs/datasets/dist_100k_atlantis_required
    # All samples will be included in concat mode
